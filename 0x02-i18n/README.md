# 0x02-i18n

This directory contains internationalization (i18n) exercises for ALX Backend specialization.

## Project Description

This project focuses on implementing internationalization features in Flask applications, including language detection, locale selection, timezone handling, and message translation.

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All files end with a new line
- Code follows pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- First line of all Python files: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All `*.py` files are executable
- All modules, classes, and functions have proper documentation
- All functions and coroutines are type-annotated

## Files

- `0-app.py`: Basic Flask application with single route
- `templates/0-index.html`: Basic HTML template for the index page

## Setup

1. Install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip3 install Flask
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python3 0-app.py
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:5000` to see the application

## Usage

The basic Flask application serves a simple webpage with "Welcome to ALX" as the title and "Hello world" as the main heading.
